# Homework-week1-claire
This is my website.
By refactoring the code provided in the homework, I created a navbar, that links its buttons to their corresponding elements/context on the screen & sized a hero image spanning the screen.  I also created floats to organise the text and images which are each positioned within containers. A footer was also made which spans the bottom of the page.
